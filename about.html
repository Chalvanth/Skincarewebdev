    <h5 class="nams1">Namaste</h5>
    <h6 class="nams1">We are the The Skin Project Project. Skincare That Works.

        Having spent years understanding the Indian skin and decoded “Skin Intelligence”, we have come up with the perfect formulations to mimic your skin’s natural care and repair mechanism. We bring to you– the one-step-routine that goes beyond and challenges the off-the-shelf skincare products that occupy your time, money and space.

    <h6 class="nams1">Our Belief

        Our skin is naturally intelligent. It has the ability to repair itself and get back to its natural self! However, age, lifestyle changes and harsh conditions often clog it’s natural goodness and slow down its intelligence. But skin intelligence can be restored… and all it needs is to feed it with the right regenerative ingredients – the superfoods, potent bioactives and peptides!

             <p class="abhd2">The Skin Project Age Prevention Superfood night repair is a rich cream for repairing and strengthening the skin. With the right balance of CoQ10, Tetrapeptides and Indian Superfoods like Moringa, Turmeric and Centella; this repair cream gives the skin cells an extra boost and promotes long term skin health.<br><br><br>

                We have researched skin types and how different the Indian skin is from the rest. We have tried to understand why the off-the-shelf products fail to work wonders on the Indian skin and that is when we stumbled upon skin intelligence and how it works. Basing that as our premise, we started exploring the role of collagen – the structural protein that gives the ability to repair and replenish the skin. With age and the depleting environments around, collagen levels go down and the skin gradually loses its ability to rebuild and rejuvenate itself. So we started researching the right ingredients for our formulations.

      <h4 class="abstory">FOUNDING STORY</h4>
      <h4 class="abstory">BEST FRIENDS. NATURE LOVERS. SKIN CARE ENTHUSIASTS</h4>
      <p class="absub">Just like any best friends, we grew up sharing our dreams and aspirations and skincare was something we were most excited about. The markets are crowded with skincare products that claim to work wonders on all types of skin.<br><br>

        A deeper look at these products made us realise how ineffective they could be on Indian skin. From diverse climatic conditions to high levels of pollution, and varying psychological factors, there are diverse factors that take a toll on the Indian skin. As we proceeded deeper into the subject, we got to know how most people start experiencing skin-related issues after 25.
        We understood the role of the dropping collagen levels and how chemicals gave instant results but left long term harm.<br><br>
        
        With enough knowledge, we decided to put our Bachelors’ Degree in Biotechnology to good useto redefine the raw state of the skincare industry in India. With this philosophy, we started exploring ingredients with the aim of ingraining nature with science and our hunt took us to naturally occurring peptides and their ability to nullify the harm caused by age, pollution and chemical treatments.<br><br>
        
        Holding on to the concept of “skin intelligence”, we pioneered natural skincare because “what you apply on the skin is as important as what goes into it”, yet, there’s the challenge of finding products with “science” and “natural” together. Our formulations offer the most skin-friendly solution to fill in this gap.<br><br>
        
        With natural ingredients extracted from Indian flowers, plants, seeds, nuts and herbs, we aim at offering you powerhouse products that make skincare a soiree.</p>
